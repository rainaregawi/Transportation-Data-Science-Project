# Zip Code Analyses of NYC Crashes (2015–2024)

A data science project conducted through the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub and the National Student Data Corps in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).  

### Overview
This project investigates crash frequency patterns across New York City from 2015–2024 using the NYC Open Data "Motor Vehicle Collisions – Crashes" dataset provided by the NYPD. The analysis identifies high-risk areas by examining trends over time, clustering of incidents by zip code, and potential contributing factors such as seasonality and geography.

### Objective
To identify NYC zip codes with consistently high motor vehicle crash frequencies and analyze temporal and spatial factors that contribute to these occurrences. Insights from this study can inform urban planning and targeted roadway safety initiatives.

### Methodology
- Cleaned and preprocessed crash data from NYC Open Data (2015–2024).  
- Removed incomplete records containing missing zip code, latitude, or longitude fields.  
- Grouped and analyzed crash counts by zip code, year, and month.  
- Conducted time series and geospatial analyses to identify frequency trends and clustering.  
- Visualized data using maps and line charts to illustrate high-risk regions and seasonal patterns.  

### Tools & Technologies
- Language: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium)  
- Tools: Google Colab  
- Data Source: NYC Open Data: Motor Vehicle Collisions – Crashes (NYPD)  

### Key Findings
- Geographic Clustering: High-crash zip codes are concentrated in Brooklyn, showing spatial clustering that may relate to infrastructure or traffic density.  
- Seasonal Trends: Increased crashes during summer and fall months suggest effects from higher travel volume and weather conditions.  
- High-Risk Zones: Zip code 11207 had the highest crash count across the study period, warranting further investigation into local conditions and safety measures.  

### Skills Demonstrated
